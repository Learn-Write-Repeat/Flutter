## Why learn flutter?
(Mayukh Sharma)

-Flutter supports the fast development process and it uses widgets which makes the UI easy to use. It gives developers complete control over the app while it is quite easy to fix bugs and do changes in a flutter, and saves a lot of time.
-Flutter uses the Dart programming language. One of the most beautiful features of flutter is it's well-prepared documentation, from where you can easily learn the syntax and other concepts. Also, flutter contains lots of libraries and widgets you can easily find on flutter documentation.
-It is ideal for Minimal Viable Product (MVP), which is a minimal version of the final app. As MVPs are an important part of the app development process today, and flutter is quickly becoming a popular choice because it greatly improves the efficiency of the MVP development process.
- The advantage of learning flutter is that it has extensions for different IDEs like Android studio and Visual studio code. It gives freedom to developers to select the IDE they are most comfortable with.
- Flutter has large community support, so if you got stuck anywhere, there will be a solution for it on the internet and the flutter developers community has exponentially grown in the last few years on different platforms such as Stack Overflow.

## What is Flutter?
(Radha)

-Client/user needs "our idea" with the help of some app so that they can implement it easily, and it doesn't matter to them, which technology we use it behind the scene. Only UI/UX, performance, service and idea  matter to them.And if want our idea to be implemented or to run, we should convert that idea into some program and show it publicly.
-Compilation of program is known as "software", which is technically known as "App".
-Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google. It actually allows us to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. 
-Flutter is just a framework which needs "Dart language" and dart is given by google.
-Dart gives us declarative approach to create something for us and converts our app into .apk file
-Native language of android is java/kotlin, and they're actually good and faster, but in terms of development they are literally very slow and hence they take lot of time and money and that's why here comes the role of flutter, it is easy efficient, simple and faster.
-Flutter gives us bespoke(custom) support.

## Look Around on Flutter!
(Puja Kumari)

In general, developing a mobile application is a complex and challenging task. There are many frameworks available to develop a mobile application. Android provides a native framework based on Java language and iOS provides a native framework based on Objective-C / Swift language.

However, to develop an application supporting both the OSs, we need to code in two different languages using two different frameworks. To help overcome this complexity, there exists mobile frameworks supporting both OS. These frameworks range from simple HTML based hybrid mobile application framework (which uses HTML for User Interface and JavaScript for application logic) to complex language specific framework (which do the heavy lifting of converting code to native code).

In this scenario, Flutter – a simple and high performances framework based on Dart language, provides high performance by rendering the UI directly in the operating system’s canvas rather than through native framework.

We shall discuss the complete architecture in the coming topics.
